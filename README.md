# Different Types of VAE models 
In this code, three types of variational autoencoder, including VAE, Beta VAE(BVAE) and Conditional VAE(CVAE), were implemented on MNIST dataset to generate synthetic MNIST images. In the conventional VAE, after training the model, there is no control on which classes of images we want to generate, as each synthetic image is generated from a noisy space and there is no condition on this noise. However, in CVAE a condition based on class number is assigned to noisy space to train our model conditionally. After training phase, we can simply generate new MNIST images with the ability of choosing which digit we want to produce. Some generated images from VAE and CVAE are depicted below. To generate each image based on its class number using VAE, we should keep sampling until we get our desired digit, whereas by CVAE only one sampling is required.

With regards to BVAE, we enforced the latent space to see its dimensions independent as much as possible. This would require us to increase the weigh of KL term in VAE’s loss function to rise the importance of approximating the latent space distribution to the normal distribution. As a result, the importance of first term in VAE loss, which is generative loss and compares the model output with the model input, will decrease, thus negatively affecting the quality of generated images. It can be seen that by increasing the weight of KL loss from 1 to 10, the quality of produced images is compromised.

However, as dimensions of latent space are less dependent, we can conduct disentangled learning, which means we can assign each dimension of latent space into a narrowly defined and interpretable feature in image space. In the below image we can see that by fixing the amount of latent space’s dimensions, except the first one which is varied between (-2.5, 2.5), produced images will change from digit 2 to 6, which means the first dimension of latent space is responsible for this special feature in image space.
