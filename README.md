# Different Types of VAE models 
In this code, three types of variational autoencoder, including VAE, Beta VAE(BVAE) and Conditional VAE(CVAE), were implemented on MNIST dataset to generate synthetic MNIST images. In the conventional VAE, after training the model, there is no control on which classes of images we want to generate, as each synthetic image is generated from a noisy space and there is no condition on this noise. However, in CVAE a condition based on class number is assigned to noisy space to train our model conditionally. After training phase, we can simply generate new MNIST images with the ability of choosing which digit we want to produce. Some generated images from VAE and CVAE are depicted below. To generate each image based on its class number using VAE, we should keep sampling until we get our desired digit, whereas by CVAE only one sampling is required.
